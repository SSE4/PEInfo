This is another Portable Executable (PE) analysing stuff.
It differs from another analysers just in way of displaying infos
(in modal dialog box but just like a log format). 
The unique difference of it is its ability to modify main headers like:
IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, IMAGE_FILE_HEADER, IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32 . 
Another ability is to show HEX dump of file, 
calculate in-fly between RVA and RAW addresses, between HEX and DECIMAL base.

Actually project developing is stopped because of another projects.
Not worth testing - very buggy. Hope fix it later ;-)
